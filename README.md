From scratch: 

Install Create React Native App
In order to use Create React Native App, go ahead and install it once globally:
```bash
npm install -g create-react-native-app
```
Alternatively, feel free to use yarn as well (visit [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) for setup instructions):

```bash
yarn global add create-react-native-app
```

If you already have Expo installed

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```
or
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
